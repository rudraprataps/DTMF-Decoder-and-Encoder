# DTMF Decoder and Encoder
This repository contains all the codes and files for DTMF Decoder and Encoder project which can be used in Signals and System Subject. 

• DTMF Encoder Decoder is very easy to use the program to decode DTMF dial tones found on telephone lines with touch-tone phones.<br/>
• DTMF is the global standard for audible tones that represent the digits on a phone keypad.<br/>
• DTMF Decoder is also used for receiving data transmissions over the air in amateur radio frequency bands.<br/>
• The signal is encoded as a pair of sinusoidal (sine wave) tones from the table below which are mixed with each other. <br/>
• Each DTMF tone is actually two tones – a low-frequency tone and a high-frequency tone combined, that’s why it is dual-tone multi-frequency.<br/>
• Looking at the standard phone keypad as a grid, the low tone corresponds to the row, while the high tone corresponds to the column.<br/>
• DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark TouchTone. The term was first used by AT&T on July 5, 1960, and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963.<br/>
